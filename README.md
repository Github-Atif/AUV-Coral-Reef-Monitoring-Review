## 🧠 Abstract

Coral reefs, vital ecosystems for marine life, face severe threats from climate change and human-induced stressors. Conventional coral monitoring methods struggle to provide scalable, high-frequency, and high-resolution data. This review explores the role of **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)** as a transformative tool for coral reef monitoring, enabling systematic, non-invasive, and repeatable assessments over large and remote reef areas.

The paper reviews conventional monitoring techniques and contrasts them with robotic approaches, highlighting advances in **visual sensing, acoustic systems, environmental sensors, and AI-driven analysis**. Key applications such as coral species identification, disease detection, bleaching assessment, and 3D reef mapping are discussed. Challenges related to navigation, autonomy, ecological impact, and standardization are identified, and open research directions are outlined to advance robotic coral reef monitoring.

## 🎯 Scope of the Review

This review focuses on **AUV-based visual coral reef monitoring**, covering:

- Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for reef inspection  
- Vision-based coral monitoring and computer vision techniques  
- AI and machine learning for coral detection, classification, and health assessment  
- 3D mapping and photogrammetry of reef structures  
- Navigation, autonomy, and mission planning in complex reef environments  
- Comparison with diver-based and traditional monitoring methods  
- Open challenges and future research directions
