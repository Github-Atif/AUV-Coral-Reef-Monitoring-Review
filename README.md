### Scope of the Review

This paper surveys the use of **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)** and robotic platforms for coral reef monitoring, with emphasis on:

- Visual sensing for coral health assessment  
- AI and computer vision for species identification and bleaching detection  
- 3D mapping and photogrammetry of reef structures  
- Navigation and autonomy in complex reef environments  
- Comparison with diver-based and traditional monitoring methods  
- Open challenges and future research directions
